2013-06-26  PELICAN 1.0.3

    * Fixed a bug in the emulator driver related to non-blocking write
      operations when sending QTcp packets.
    * Updated the logic of the DataReciever class to allow chunkers to
      reconnect to dropped sockets.
    * Added an example to demonstrate an emulator, server, and pipeline
      configuration using a TCP/IP based chunker. This example has been designed
      to report the throughput bandwidth for such a system.
    * Updated handling of default TCP communication between the pelican server
      and pelican server client to blocking socket operations - This is not
      envisaged to alter the behaviour of existing code using pelican.


2013-01-29  PELICAN 1.0.2

    * Updated version number in doxygen targets
    * Updated FindPelican.cmake script to fix an issue for projects
      using an install of pelican in a non-default install location.

2013-01-22  PELICAN 1.0.1

    * Adding missing build_macros cmake script!

2013-01-21  PELICAN 1.0.0

    * First versioned release!
    * Complete rework of the modular build system.
    * Rework of the build system macro for copying files.
    * Updated header include paths thoughout pelican, removing the pelican
      prefix. Projects using FindPelican.cmake will need to update to the
      new version of this script.
    * Updated Doxygen documentation configuration files to work correctly with
      Doxygen 1.8.x.
    * Moved object registration macros out of pelican namespace in order
      to make code using PELICAN slightly cleaner. This change will not effect
      codes already using PELICAN but allow more friendly namespace usage
      in future. Macros affected:
         PELICAN_DECLARE_ADAPTER
         PELICAN_DECLARE_CLIENT
         PELICAN_DECLARE_MODULE
         PELICAN_DECLARE_DATABLOB
         PELICAN_DECLARE_CHUNKER
    * Added an additional example code (examples/example-1) which demonstrates
      the use of pelican with service data.
